### 🧠 TransAugNet — Transformer-Aware Cyclic Augmentation for Biomedical Image Analysis

Repository for TransAugNet, a deep learning–based biomedical image analysis framework that enables accurate and fast disease detection from 3D medical images using ResNet3D-50 and Transformer-Aware Cyclic Augmentation.

---

## 📌 Summary

### Two main Objectives:

1. 🩺 Disease Classification
   → Automatically classify medical images as Healthy / Diseased

2. ⏱️ Fast Diagnosis Support 
   → Reduce diagnosis time from minutes to seconds for clinical decision support
